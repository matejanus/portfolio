          <p>
            Electronics engineer with 2 years experience in programming in
            Python and C/C++. Besides experience in programming I can also
            design electronic circuits and printed circuit boards. I learn new
            technologies quickly and willingly, I can work in a team and I am
            not afraid of new challenges. I finished my master's degree in 2019
            at the Wrocław University of Technology with excellent results and I
            was nominated for the competition of top 10 graduates. In my free
            time I like to develop my programming skills, but I also like
            rollerblading and traveling. since 2015 I am an active member of the
            MOS(microsystem oriented society) science club. During my activity
            in the science club I realized shows of the P.I.W.O. project and
            further developed the new system. Moreover, I was the leader of the
            Arcade Machine project and now I am the leader of the alarm/smart
            home project for the science club laboratory.
