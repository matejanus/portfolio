          <h3 class="text-secondary">About the project</h3>
          <p>
            The project was carried out in a group of 3 people as part of the
            team project classes in engineering studies. The goal of the project
            was to create a balancing robot that would follow the tennis ball.
            Reaching the target was supposed to be indicated by a sound signal,
            and it was to be able to be remotely controlled by a mobile
            application. We wanted to stabilize the robot on two wheels by using
            accelerometers and gyros to control the engines (PID). Image
            recognition was mainly my task. I managed to realize them by
            implementing a neural network from prepared samples. The problem was
            the influence of external lights, but I managed to recognize the
            ball in real time, however, we could not achieve stabilization of
            the robot on 2 wheels, so we limited its functionality to locate the
            ball and drive up to it, and to remote control of the robot through
            bluetooth and a mobile application.

          <p>
            This is the first version of the robot that was supposed to be
            stable on two wheels, but due to the used engines, we were unable to
            achieve stabilization.
